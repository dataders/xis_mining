Major Comparisons to make:
1) Teachers: All
2) Students: ALL
3) subjects: ALL
4) improvement: 'went down', 'no change', 'improved'
5) phase of english: ALL

What I still have to do
1) Prune common ngrams
2) ask MB to check csv export feature


Ask on SO:
1) TM: Remove names by document
2) comparing different people
        a) option 1:
                term freq: how often a teacher uses a phrase
                inv doc freq: inverse weighting how common a phrase is
3) TM: customize tf-idf for ngram length

Maybes:
1) Build a shiny app?
