8MYPSCI01,Sciences,Pegeen Crockett,8,10002014,Yun,Chai Young,20160307,Sci-Sum Crit B & C chemistry design lab,Summative,Laboratory Work,NA,6,4,NA,NA,"For Criteria B, Chai Young is able to describe a research question to be tested.  She is able to outline and explain a testable hypothesis using scientific reasoning, but needs to use correct scientific reasoning.  Her science did not agree with the research she did.  She is able to describe how to manipulate variables and how sufficient relevant data will be collected, but she needs to identify the tools used for controlling variables and how that affects her data.  She is able to design a safe and logical method, but should make sure she details out the tools used.  For Criteria C, she is able to correctly collect some raw data and present it in a visual form, but she needs to present all her raw data and then process it into a graph so she can see the trends.  She is able to accurately interpret data for the most part and describe the results using mostly correct scientific reasoning.  She is able to state the validity of the hypothesis, but she needs to be able to discuss it’s validity related to the results.  She is able to discuss the validity of the method based on the results.  She is able to state limited improvements to the method.  She needs to be able to describe improvements that match to her weaknesses of her lab."
8MYPSCI01,Sciences,Pegeen Crockett,8,10001634,Lam,Chi Ham,20160307,Sci-Sum Crit B & C chemistry design lab,Summative,Laboratory Work,NA,3,2,NA,NA,"For Criteria B, Chi Ham is able to describe his research question but wasn’t able to state it.  He was able to outline and explain a testable hypothesis.  He was able to state some of the variables in the lab, but needs to be able for identify all of them as well as the control variables.  He needs to be able to explain how he will manipulate these variables for a fair test.  He is able to produce a limited method, but needs to be able to design a logical, complete and safe method with details.  For Criteria C, he is able to collect some data, but should work on designing a lab that he can collect all of his data and present it in a visual form.  He was not able to process the data.  He is able to provide some limited analysis of the data, but because his data was limited, it limited the amount of analysis he could do.  He is able to validate his hypothesis compared to the results, but that as well is somewhat limited due to his data.  He was not able to achieve any standard for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses within his lab.  He was not able to reach any standard for lab improvements since he wasn’t able to recognize any weaknesses within the lab."
