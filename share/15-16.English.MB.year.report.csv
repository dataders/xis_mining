Allen Jing-Nam shows an understanding of texts and concepts studied in Grade 6 English Language and Literature. He is able to clearly show his understanding when supported through the process. However, Allen’s current approach to his learning prevents him from achieving higher levels of success. Allen must continue to develop independence in his learning. This means working on his self-management skills such as organizing his time, planning for the completion of work and maintaining focus on individual tasks. Allen must take ownership of his learning and express initiative to improve his performance. ",3,3,3,3,12,3,"
Allen’s approach to his learning means that he does not produce the quality of work of which he is capable. Currently, Allen cannot work independently to complete a task, instead requiring direct instruction and repeated reminders to focus on the learning that is happening in English. There is also large concern with Allen’s homework as he fails to regularly complete any tasks assigned. This has a detrimental effect on his understanding, as the knowledge and concepts learned in class are not reinforced. In the most recent unit, Allen showed some interest in completing the summative task, as it involved technology, but his lack of self-management skills meant that while he did to complete the task, he only did so at the last minute, resulting in an unfinished product. Allen must take ownership of his learning and responsibility for his actions.   ",3,3,3,3,12,3,"
Allen’s approach to his learning has been varied this year. When Allen engages in his work he can produce pleasing results, shows enjoyment of the task and is clearly proud of the outcome. However, Allen becomes distracted too easily or dismisses the task at hand. Allen must continue to work on his perseverance and determination to produce work he can be proud of. This includes developing strategies to bounce back from challenges he faces, and using positive self-talk to stay committed even when something is difficult. Allen will continue to grow in his ability in English, with a positive approach to his learning. ",-0.666666666666667,0,-0.666666666666667

An Lin shows an excellent understanding of the concepts inquired into in the Grade 6 English Language and Literature course. This was evident from the understanding she showed in the oral presentation based on the environmental issues in the film The Lorax. An Lin clearly has significant oral communication skills and speaks confidently and with ease while engaging her audience.  However, it is essential that An Lin take the time to carefully understand the requirements and expectations of all tasks before completing them. It is essential that An Lin support her discussion of key ideas with specific evidence from the text she is analyzing. This will help her to build a stronger argument and clearer purpose for written work and oral presentations. ",4,4,4,5,17,4.25,"
An Lin shows a very good understanding of the texts and concepts studied in English Language and Literature and has achieved consistent results in her summative assessments. An Lin needs to take more time and care with her work, whether formative or summative, to see a significant improvement in her outcomes for criteria. This includes paying close attention to detail in her writing and challenging herself to use increasingly complex vocabulary as well as choosing sophisticated examples to support her ideas. An Lin has shown that she is a confident presenter and is capable of excellent levels of achievement in this subject. I look forward to seeing her pay close attention to detail in our upcoming poetry unit. ",4,4,4,5,17,4.25,"
An Lin has produced consistent results in her English Language and Literature course this year. She contributes to the class by readily supporting others in their understanding of class work or the requirements of tasks. However, An Lin’s results continue not to reflect her level of understanding. It is clear from discussion that she has a sophisticated understanding of the concepts and texts studied but this does not transfer to her written work. While An Lin is able to effectively communicate her ideas in writing she should continue to work on being thorough and showing depth when developing ideas. ",-0.75,0,-0.75

Chiao-chun shows a good understanding of the texts and concepts studied in Grade 6 English Language and Literature. However Chiao-chun’s challenge is transferring this understanding to summative tasks such as pieces of writing or oral presentations. Chiao-chun needs to work on understanding the requirements and expectations of summative tasks, through careful examination of the task description and criterion. She must also begin to ask questions and actively seek feedback to improve her performance. It is important that she acts on the advice given in formative tasks to improve her level of success in the summative assessment. ",4,4,4,4,16,4,"
Chiao-chun is steadily improving her skills in English Language and Literature, in particular her ability to analyse text, both familiar and unfamiliar, and organize her ideas in writing. She has begun to ask questions to clarify her understanding and is beginning to actively seek feedback on her work. In the most recent summative Chiao-chun showed that she should work on the choices she makes in her language when writing, and consider how she can respond to a question or text in a creative way. Chiao-chun sometimes struggles to generate ideas for her writing and needs to take the time to consider her perspective on a topic before writing. ",4,4,4,3,15,3.75,"
Chiao-Chun has made significant improvements in her ability to analyse text, as shown through the final summative task where she was able to make some perceptive comments about texts, while investigating her hypothesis about identity. She continues to work on expressing herself clearly in English, using language accurately to communicate, and organizing her ideas in paragraphs. Chiao-Chun has shown a very good work ethic this year and with continued support and practice will see improvement in these areas of language development. ",0.416666666666667,-0.25,0.416666666666667

Darryl shows an understanding of the concepts and texts studied in Grade 6 English Language and Literature through his thorough, positive contribution to class discussion. Darryl takes an active role in the class and supports others’ learning. Darryl needs to work on developing his ideas both in written pieces of work as well as oral presentations. In his oral presentation for The Lorax, Darryl included very few examples from the text, which are necessary for developing an argument. By further explaining his topic sentences in writing and the points made in oral presentations, Darryl will be able to present a more developed argument and show his thorough understanding. ",4,4,5,4,17,4.25,"
Darryl has improved in three of the criteria assessed in this subject, analysing, organising and using language. As Darryl has become more comfortable with the expectations of this course, the tasks he faces and the criteria he is assessed on, Darryl has been able to produce higher quality work. In the most recent summative, Darryl produced a video to communicate his perspective on the impact of technology on communication. He showed interest in this task and was able to produce text that showed a creative approach to this topic. However he must continue to work on the depth of his responses and aim to be thorough in explaining points he is arguing. A more methodical approach to completing tasks will allow Darryl to produce a stronger argument both in written tasks and oral presentations.  ",4,4,3,4,15,3.75,"
In the final summative for this year Darryl showed an improved ability to analyse texts in English and was able to make a clear connection between his hypothesis and some of the texts he chose to analyse. Darryl continues to work on producing creative or original texts, showing an inconsistency in his Criterion C, Producing Text, results, and must work on thorough description when producing text.

In particular it has been difficult for her to become comfortable with the expectations of homework. I encourage Fayre to take a more proactive approach to her learning. She must manage her time carefully so she is able to complete all homework and class work, and to a high level. Fayre must take the initiative to ask questions about her learning, seeking advice and feedback early, rather than leaving questions too late. In the most recent summative task Fayre produced a blog that expressed her opinion about communication technology. She worked well with guidance and was able to produce a well-structured response that showed a clear perspective on the topic. I encourage Fayre to take more ownership of learning and build a more independent approach to completing tasks.",3,3,3,2,11,2.75,"
Fayre has taken the positive step to seek support and guidance when she faces challenges in her learning in this subject.

This beginning of the year included may class discussions where Betty’s participation was generally good, but I encourage her to be an academic risk-taker and try to participate more. Her analysis in her writing can be improved in two ways: having a clear thesis and using precise details from the text to support her argument.  She will continue to have opportunities to analyze various text types as the year progresses. Her portrayal of Father John in the public forum debate between the Montagues and Capulets demonstrated personal engagement with the creative process.   I look forward to hearing her interview as Friar John as she analyzes his contribution to the deaths of Romeo and Juliet in a radio interview. ",3,3,4,4,14,3.5,"
Betty has made adequate progress this trimester, but I think she could be making more.  Her journal for identity was amazing and she has a knack for adding details in her autobiographical writing. Most confusing was her essay this trimester.  She turned it in early and got peer feedback and feedback from me.  I wrote that she needed to improve her thesis for her essay.  However, her final essay contained the same thesis that she submitted for her first draft—there was no visible attempt at improvement, nor did she ask for help.  We also had a whole class activity to discuss how to create effective thesis statements.  For the last trimester, I encourage Betty to take control of her learning.  If she does not know how to do something that I’m expecting, please come to see me at lunch, send an email, or at the very least, just try (you might surprise yourself).",3,3,5,4,15,3.75,"

She understands the rubric and holds herself to an incredibly high standard—which is resulting in impressive work.  This trimester in her writing, I have seen great improvement in quotation integration and the development of the ideas.  She needs to be attentive to feedback from peers and the teacher on writing assignments.

Hsun Te has not submitted most formative assignments. He was unprepared for most class discussions. Attention to each learning opportunity will only benefit his study of the English language. One highlight for him this trimester was his performance as a servant to the Capulets during a public form debate: He convincingly captured the voice of the servant who bit his thumb.

Not surprisingly, Hsun Te has not improved much this year and is even starting to fall behind his peers. While he is always polite and participates in class discussions, this is not enough to help him improve at the rate expected in this class.  The missing assignments indicate that his self-management (one of the approaches to learning, ATLs, which includes perseverance, time-management, and self-motivation) is an area where improvement is needed.

For final assessment, King Ki was able to combine creativity and an intimate knowledge of the text to produce an interesting and thought provoking script. In a recent public form debate between the Montagues and Capulets, King Ki argued as Friar Lawrence and incorporated the original text well.

King Ki continues to participate well in class discussions and turn in work of a high quality.  She applies feedback from both her peers and the teacher.  Even though she claims to not like reading, she appears to be preparing for class and has good reading comprehension.  Her comparative essay was well done in all areas.

For the third trimester, I encourage her to continue to keep up the phenomenal diligence.",6,6,6,8,26,6.5,"
King Ki seemed more distracted this trimester. However, her work continues to be of a high quality.  She submits all assignments on time and strives for excellence, but is dismissive of this as an achievement since she simply has high expectations of herself. The Interdisciplinary Unit allowed for a lot of flexibility of time management, and her group struggled to meet deadlines.  Perhaps when working in groups, it would be helpful to be mindful of the time. King Ki is ready for the challenges of preparing for the Diploma Programme.

Laura missed a lot of class this trimester and did not make up the formative work.  I encourage her to be proactive—I will be happy to help her complete the work and catch up when she asks; however, it is her responsibility to schedule a meeting time. One way to improve her production of text (both written and oral) is to support her ideas with the original text as much as possible. Continued attention to the rules of grammar and vocabulary development will help improve her language usage.  During class discussion, she actively participates and has been prepared.

Laura has missed many opportunities to practice her skills in preparation for the summative assessments by failing to turn in homework or complete assignments.  Even with support on Thursdays, several assignments are still missing.  As a result, her Criterion D: Language, which includes vocabulary and grammar, is not up to the expectation of the class.  For her Reading for Pleasure presentation, she did not submit a proposal (which is a formative task) so again missed an opportunity to improve. The final result was poor presentation where she read off her phone. I know she is capable of great presentations as I have working with her in drama. The missing assignments indicate that her self-management (one of the approaches to learning, ATLs, which includes perseverance, time-management, and self-motivation) is an area where improvement is needed.

Leo participates well in class and makes insightful observations during discussions.

Angel’s work is inconsistent. The opportunities for improvement are available in class, but she must do her part by completing homework and formative assessments.  For example, this trimester the students wrote an essay and got feedback from both peers and the teacher before preparing a final essay for the summative assessment.  Since she had not completed the first draft, she never got feedback.  The result was that her final essay did not exhibit the high standard expected in this class.

Yu-Hsiang works well with others and shares his ideas when working in partners. He struggles however, to make use of his notes and put forth his ideas in group and class discussions. Yu-Hsiang also has difficulties understanding and implementing organizational structures in order to clearly analyze and use language effectively. Being aware of the expectations of the particular task and the details he must provide in order to achieve success will help him to grow in our class.

Chang Min took a while to adjust to the routines and expectations of the course; however, he has shown some improvement since arriving at XIS.  He has especially improved the development of his paragraphs—although he still relies too heavily on summary, there is a glimmer of analysis emerging in his writing as he observes the effect of a stylistic feature on the reader. Chang Min could have made more progress, but several assignments were late or not submitted at all.  As he prepares for the Diploma Programme, I encourage him to read for pleasure over the summer and pay attention to HOW the author is creating the message and the EFFECT of that message on himself as a reader.

Hong Bin started the year with limited participation in discussion.  He has improved and is speaking more often and with insightful comments.  During formative assessment, where there is support, Hong Bin scores higher than in summative situations where he is expected to apply what he has learned.  I encourage Hong Bin to further develop transfer skills and seeking support in the form of asking questions as he creates a summative assessment.  He is given class time to work on the assessments and I check for understanding, so he can start to think of precise questions to ask during these times.  I hope to hear these pointed questions as he develops his summative and formative assessments in the current unit on Human Rights. ",3,3,3,6,15,3.75,"
Hong Bin is always attentive in class and participates well.  His challenge when writing is synthesizing and analyzing information to create a strong arguable thesis.  This is affecting his ability to express his understanding, his analysis, and his organization in his papers.  Next trimester, the class will work to prepare for Paper 1 (unseen texts) in the DP program by working on skills and strategies for writing about a previously unseen work in a timed setting.  The development of a thesis and the ability to analyze will be stressed and practiced, so hopefully with diligence, Hong Bin can improve in criterion A and B.",4,4,3,6,17,4.25,"
Hong Bin still struggles to communicate his ideas in writing.  While he is able to write sophisticated and interesting thesis statements, the development of his essay usually is not as strong.  To improve, he should continue to incorporate evidence and refer back to his thesis statement while analyzing the text—sometimes he tends to veer away from the connection between the thesis and the text.   Remember this:  write about the text, not the topic.  He rewrote his analysis of a poem (from an analytical essay exam) and improved his analysis. I encourage him to continue this diligence in his new school.  Best of luck to you, Athan. ",1.75,0.5,1.75

Jasper is missing one important formative assignment: the TEXAS paragraph.  He was given an opportunity to redo the assignment and worked in class with a partner, yet he still failed to turn this in. The ATL (approach to learning) most related to this relates to organizational skills—he can benefit from seeing the connection of the formative assessments to the summative.  His final paper demonstrated limited analysis and adequate organization.  He participates in discussions and shows enthusiasm about the stories when he is prepared.  He will have more opportunities to build the skills needed to achieve excellence on his summative assessments.  I encourage Jasper to be mindful of the steps leading to the summative task for the current unit on Human Rights. ",2,4,3,4,13,3.25,"
Hsiao-Chien has spent most of the second half of the trimester with Ms. Grocott doing a guided study of the novel SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE.  He struggled to complete any of the formative assessment with quality or depth. According to his self-evaluation on the outline he completed at the beginning of the trimester, he had a clear sense of the expectations of the class.  However, he is not achieving at the top levels.  In order to show higher achievement on the summative assessments, I suggest he strive for excellence on each formative assessment as he prepares for classes.  ",3,4,3,5,15,3.75,"
Hsiao-Chien’s work is inconsistent.  He has several missing and late daily assignments—this indicates he can work on his self-management (one of the approaches to learning, ATLs), which includes perseverance, time-management, and self-motivation.  However, at other times, his work is quite impressive.  He scored very well on his end-of-the-year vocabulary and grammar test.  He also submitted a thoughtful reflection on the feedback to his pastiche of a Frost poem.  In class, Hsaio-Chien is attentive and participates with enthusiasm. 

As he prepares for HL Language and Literature, he should read for pleasure over the summer. In addition, he should focus how the author is making choices to create an impact on the reader.  When reading blogs, newspapers, or magazines, he should also note the organization.  Giving attention to these aspects will help as she learns to write more in depth about them. ",1.25,0.5,1.25

Jin Su is quiet in class, so I encourage him to take the academic risk to speak more during discussions.  Daily work becomes especially important to prepare for class discussions.  His performance is inconsistent—he scores higher on his summative assignments than in the formative work.  I encourage him to reflect on this pattern and how it affects his ability to participate. I was impressed with his TED Talk where he connected the racism in South Korea to the racism in the text.  His essay about Poe’s writing was grounded in comparative linguistics, and it was well-organized.  I look forward to seeing how Jin Su approaches the current unit on Human Rights. ",4,4,4,4,16,4,"
Jin Su has spent most of the second half of the trimester with Ms. Grocott doing a guided study of the novel SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE.  It appears that he struggled with comprehension of the text, although his final essay (which was written in class) showed some good analysis.  The first part of the semester, he had to complete a outline and a self-reflection.  He did not follow instructions as posted on ManageBac and consequently did not receive calibration of his self-expectation to the expectation at this level.  According to his self-evaluation on the rubric, he believes he is achieving at a much higher standard than I do.  I recommend that Jin Su turn in all assessments (formative and summative) and homework to increase the practice he gets on all of the criteria as this is what he needs to be achieving at the standard expected at his level.

",4,5,5,4,18,4.5,"
Jin Su could have made more progress, but several assignments were late or not submitted at all. Furthermore, some of the formative work he submitted (Reading for Pleasure Journal, reflection on the feedback for his pastiche, and the proposal for his Reading for Pleasure project) did not meet the expectation of the class.  He had opportunities to redo some of the assignments and was sent for study support for several weeks.  While English is not his first language, the primary concern I have is for his approach to learning (ATL) of self-management, which includes perseverance, time-management, and self-motivation. He ended the trimester by redoing some assignments, so this makes me think he wants to improve and is willing to now do the work.  As he prepares for the Diploma Programme, I encourage him to read over the summer and pay attention to HOW the author is creating the message and the EFFECT of that message on himself as a reader.  Then, I encourage him to establish “so what” and find meaning for himself in all that he experiences.",0,0.5,0

Kynza participates well in class and seems to enjoy the learning activities.  She is skilled at finding ways to relate the texts we read to her own life—personal connections, I believe, are possibly the most important element to the study of literature. Her work on her magazine article was very well formatted and, by far, the most visually accurate text.  In formative situations, where there is support, she is able to organize and analyze well.  She will continue to have opportunities to transfer those skills to new situations (the summative assignments).  In class discussions, she listens and then speaks with insight.  I look forward to seeing what Kynza produces for the current unit on Human Rights. ",4,3,6,5,18,4.5,"
Kynza continues to participate well and seek clarification when she is unclear about an assignment or concept.  However, while she is making progress, I feel like she can be achieving more.  She is missing many formative assessments and homework assignments and this is limiting her learning opportunities.  When it comes time for the summative assessments, it is often too late to make up for the missed practice or clarification.  She wrote a very good essay this trimester after going through a rigorous revision process.  Kynza, for this last trimester I suggest you do the formative assessments and the homework.  All of this practice can contribute to a higher performance on your summative assessments.  Next trimester, the class will work to prepare for Paper 1 (unseen texts) in the DP program by working on skills and strategies for writing about a previously unseen work in a timed setting.  As Kynza finds it difficult to complete essays in a timed situation, this is going to be a challenge.  However, hopefully the practice of the skills will build both the confidence and the proficiency to complete these to a high standard.",4,4,6,7,21,5.25,"
Kynza has had a successful year in English.  She appeared engaged in all class activities, participated in discussions, and appeared to enjoy what we studied in class.  Her work has improved across all criteria as well.  After the practice timed write, she was given the advice to work on time management.  She applied this tip and was much more successful during the exam.  On her final exam, she struggled with the basic comprehension of the texts, but managed to write a developed and organized essay.

Overall, On Tim’s work is consistently of a high standard.  Her TED Talk on gender equality was most impressive: She paid great attention to detail, was well organized, and engaged her audience.  Her attention to detail when creating the stage for the TED Talk was remarkable.  On Tim’s demonstrates strong self-management by asking for guidance as she is working as well as managing time.

On Tim’s continues to participate and complete tasks with enthusiasm.  I know she really enjoyed the novel this trimester, and her final exam demonstrates both high engagement and achievement. The text was quite challenging due to its unconventional plot development and science fiction elements.  On Tim pays attention to detail and sets a high standards for herself.  One area to work on will be spontaneity.  Next trimester, the class will work to prepare for Paper 1 (unseen texts) in the DP program by working on skills and strategies for writing about a previously unseen work in a timed setting. This will be a challenge for On Tim, but this is exactly what she is ready to conquer. ",7,7,8,7,29,7.25,"
On Tim has had a great year in English.  While she started strong and developed in all areas throughout the year, perhaps she can be most proud of her work on the unseen texts.  Earlier in the year, she doubted her ability to analyze without extensive prior preparation.  She has proven to herself on the final exam that she is not only capable, but also quite good at discerning what to analyze, organizing her ideas, and writing in a clear, cohesive manner.  She is ready for the work awaiting her in HL Language and Literature.

Over the summer as On Tim prepares for HL Language and Literature, I know she has plans to read for pleasure.  In addition, she should focus how the author is making choices to create an impact on the reader.  When reading blogs, newspapers, or magazines, she should also note the organization.  Giving attention to these aspects will help as she learns to write more in depth about them.

Qian Qian participates well in class and is a leader in class discussions.  She prepares well and brings insightful comments.  She has demonstrated close attention to detail by drawing an image for the Editorial article that she wrote.  To improve her written work and spoken text, she needs to work on using organizational structures that the reader can follow and anticipate—this is her role as a writer. Qian Qian has taken the opportunity to redo the TEXAS assignment to improve her organization, and I will continue to work with her on transitions and the organization of her writing.   Our current unit is on Human Rights, and I look forward to seeing what she produces. ",7,7,6,7,27,6.75,"
Qian Qian continues to participate well and turn in high quality formative and summative assessments.  Her independent reading journal on I AM MALALA was thoughtful and carefully completed—she seemed engaged with the text. Her presentation for the reading for pleasure program was interesting and she used an effective, creative visual aid. Her final paper, an essay in a supervised timed-write situation, was exceptionally well done.  Her grammar and syntax continue to be her weakest point, although due to close attention, I am seeing strides toward improvement for Criterion D (Language Usage) as well.  I suggest Qian Qian continue the grammar work with the weekly vocabulary assignments as they seem to be helping.",7,7,7,7,28,7,"
Qian Qian has had a great year in English.  Qian Qian proves that paying attention to an area of weakness can bring about improvement. At the beginning of the year, her ability to write with clear syntax and grammar was adequate, but often the mistakes were distracting.  She redid many assignments until she understood the mistakes she was making.  On her final vocabulary and grammar test, she got a perfect score.  Even in the pressure of a timed-write, she demonstrated excellent language use.  Her ability to analyze and reflect deeply on the concepts of literature has also developed over the year.  Qian Qian is able to discuss literature in a sophisticated manner, and should she change her mind about her Group 1 selection, she is perfectly capable and would most likely also be successful if she joined HL Language and Literature next year.

Rahul seems interested in the class topics. I encourage him to speak with confidence—he has good ideas and is ready to be an academic risk-taker by participating more in discussions. To improve his writing, he can work on the organization (he did well on this for his TED Talk) and linking all of his ideas back to his thesis statement.  While his TED Talk was well organized, he did not connect his ideas back to the text as much as he should have.  When given the opportunity to redo the formative assessment of a TEXAS paragraph, he did not submit a revision.  I hope to provide more opportunities for revision and hope he will take advantage of them.  Knowing his passion on the topic of poverty, I look forward to seeing what he produces for the Human Rights unit we are currently studying. 
",5,6,4,6,21,5.25,"

Rahul is a thoughtful speaker and writer. When given time and support, he is able to produce good work.  He is generally prepared and utilizes the revision process well. However, he struggles in situations where he is supposed to write about something not studied previously (this skill in needed for the DP Paper 1).  So, my suggestion is that in addition to noticing the minute details, he also try to make more connections as he reads. On his last paper, he showed great progress on his analysis. During trimester 3, students will be developing analysis skills by writing a lot of spontaneous papers as they prepare for the DP and this practice has potential to greatly benefit him.
",5,5,6,6,22,5.5,"
Rahul has shown steady progress over the year.  Always appearing engaged and interested in the content of the class, Rahul can continue to challenge himself to speak more in class. This trimester he did not submit a reflection on his pastiche that was based on a Robert Frost poem. While Rahul still has room for improvement in terms of analysis, one important area that Rahul has improved in is his ability to write a clear, arguable thesis statement for an essay. He appears to enjoy experimenting with new vocabulary, which leads him to learning how to integrate new words into his writing.

Over the summer as Rahul prepares for HL Language and Literature, I recommend that he read for pleasure.  In addition, he should focus how the author is making choices to create an impact on the reader.  When reading blogs, newspapers, or magazines, he should also note the organization.

Shih-Han has been consistent in her work.  What is important now is to focus on the fine line between competence and effectiveness or perceptiveness.   For organization, this shift is dependent on Shih-Han thinking carefully about the effect of her text on her audience.  For analysis, she must begin to illustrate her exact thought process so that the reader is following her line of logic.  She will have the opportunity to continue to develop these skills in the current unit on Human Rights, and I look forward to seeing what she produces. ",7,7,5,6,25,6.25,"
Shih-Han continues to do well on both formative and summative assessments.  She applies feedback and learns from her mistakes.  Her work is up to the top standard for MYP when she has time to prepare for an assignment.  However, next trimester, the class will work to prepare for Paper 1 (unseen texts) in the DP program by working on skills and strategies for writing about a previously unseen work in a timed setting.  These papers will challenge Shih-Han; however, the ability to analyze spontaneously is exactly conforms with the next set of skills she needs to hone.  For this last trimester at XIS, I encourage Shih-Han to continue to strive for excellence.",7,8,7,7,29,7.25,"
Shih-Han has been a pleasure to teach.  She seems engaged in the material and always participates in discussions.  She approaches Language and Literature with curiosity, which leads her to discover new connections and delight in hew insights.  She seems to enjoy literature and this has influenced her work.  She completes all homework on time and this has helped her make great improvements.  Shih-Han’s resilience and perseverance are apparent when looking at her vocabulary and grammar work.

Su Jung consistently does fine work. She participates well in class discussions and is always prepared.  She appears to strive for excellence in all she does and seems interested in the themes the literature presents.  One way to improve the analysis of a test is to write about the text as if the reader would have a totally different interpretation.  This way, Su Jung will have to lead the reader through her thinking process—which becomes the analysis.  She has begun to incorporate quotations with skill.  I look forward to seeing what Su Jung produces in the current unit on Human Rights.    ",5,7,7,8,27,6.75,"
Su Jung continues to do well in class discussions and on assignments.  Earlier this trimester she expressed concern about her ability to analyze.  While she is making some strides in this area, she still needs to develop the skills to evaluate what is essential to be analyzed in a text.   This takes practice.  Luckily for Su Jung, next trimester, the class will work to prepare for Paper 1 (unseen texts) in the DP program by working on skills and strategies for writing about a previously unseen work in a timed setting.  In doing this, student will be exposed to many different texts where they must discern what is worth being analyzed and then proceed to do so. This guided practice should help her refine her analysis skills in literature and non-fiction.
",8,8,7,8,31,7.75,"
Su Jung is a superstar.  She consistently scores high in all areas of Language and Literature.  Whenever she has a weakness, she attacks it until she has mastered the skill or content. I was most impressed with her final exam.  While she expressed some discomfort about the difficulty of an exam modeled on an HL Diploma Program assessment, she rose to the challenge and performed at a sophisticated level.  Should she decide she would like to take HL English Language and Literature, she would be welcome.  It has been a pleasure to teach her this year and to see her excited about literature.

Suk Jun is ready to take the academic risk of participating more in class discussions.  He can benefit by seeking to connect the themes of literature to his own life. He succeeded in doing this for his TED Talk as he skillfully integrated his knowledge of technology with his presentation.  His written work has shown room for improvement.  When he took the opportunity to rewrite his TEXAS paragraph with a partner, they were able to demonstrate competency in organization, analysis, and language use.  Now, he needs to transfer this ability to other assignments. I look forward to seeing what Suk Jun produces for the current unit on Human Rights.",4,6,5,4,19,4.75,"
Suk Jun’s has difficulty analyzing literary texts.  When guided, he is able to repeat what is discussed or can use alternative methods to find ways to support his understanding.  However, in a situation with an unseen text, he struggles.  Next trimester, the class will work to prepare for Paper 1 (unseen texts) in the DP program by working on skills and strategies for writing about a previously unseen work in a timed setting.  Hopefully this practice will help improve his ability to think originally about a text.  Another area of concern is his Language Usage.  I have set up a grammar and vocabulary program, but he is choosing not to complete the formative tasks.  Since his last exam was not up to the standard expected at this level, I will be expecting him to complete all grammar tasks and to revise them until perfect so that he develops better habits.  ",4,6,6,4,20,5,"
Suk Jun has made improvements across all criteria this year. During the third trimester, his engagement and focus seemed improved as evidenced by his attentiveness in class and the completion of homework assignments.  When he concentrates on grammar, as he did on his final vocabulary-grammar test, he can do quite well.  However, he also needs to concentrate on it when he is in other situations, such as the timed-write during class.  His ability to analyze has improved, but when writing, he can work on making each paragraph more developed using either the TEXAS (Topic, Expand, eXample, Analysis, Set up the next paragraph) or PEAR (Point, Example, Analysis, Reactions of audience) techniques.  I encourage Suk Jun to continue to strive for excellence next year when he enters the Diploma Programme. ",1.25,0.25,1.25

Yan-ting seems interested in the class topics—although he is easily distracted.  While working on assessments, he likes to seek guidance.  I encourage him to work on trusting himself and being an academic risk-taker.  His last assessment, the essay on Gothic Literature, showed improvement in analysis and language usage.  While his first summative assessment was inadequately organized, he is improving. Yan-ting is great to have in class as he has lovely energy and enthusiasm.  I look forward to seeing what he produces for the current unit on Human Rights. ",6,6,4,6,22,5.5,"
Yan-ting’s work has been inconsistent. Overall, he has been better prepared for classes this trimester—although he still occasionally comes unprepared.  I encourage him to always strive for excellence. After one of his assignments, his self-assessment was calibrated with my evaluation, and I think he has a better understanding of what is expected.  His most recent summative assessment was the best he has done so far, so evidence suggests progress is being made. He seems to work well under timed conditions where revision is not needed. I encourage him to continue to complete homework and ask questions as needed during trimester 3.  We will be doing a lot of writing to prepare for DP.  ",5,6,7,6,24,6,"
While Yan-ting still has room to develop his analytical skills, he has shown improvement.  This trimester, his pastiche on an Emily Dickinson poem showed his ability to look closely at poetic devices (stylistic features) and emulate them to his own writing. Yan-ting’s work ethic has greatly improved since the beginning of the year, and he has made corrections on several assignments to improve his learning and has been completing his homework.  He has demonstrated greater independence this trimester as well.  

Over the summer as Yan-ting prepares for HL Language and Literature, I recommend that he read for pleasure.  In addition, he should focus how the author is making choices to create an impact on the reader.  When reading blogs, newspapers, or magazines, he should also note the organization.

I will continue to help Ze Yan with his organizational skills.  He has relatively  few marks this trimester due to missing work.  Unfortunately, he missed the opportunity for advice on writing by not handing in the TEXAS paragraph.  When given the chance to redo it with a partner in class, he again did not turn it in.  These missed opportunities are reflected in the scores of his summative assessments.  His participation in the discussions is good.  As we begin the assessments for the current unit on Human Rights, it will be important for Ze Yan to be sure he is completing the daily tasks along the way in order to maximize his learning potential.

However, most of his work was late or missing and he spent nearly every week in study support for English—this indicates that his self-management (one of the approaches to learning, ATLs, which includes perseverance, time-management, and self-motivation) is an area where improvement is needed. He opted out of many opportunities to improve with practice or through making corrections and limited his progress.  In class his participation was generally good (although his phone is occasionally a distraction), and he seemed to usually be engaged with the discussions. As he prepares for the Diploma Programme, I encourage him to read over the summer and pay attention to HOW the author is creating the message and the EFFECT of that on himself as a reader.
